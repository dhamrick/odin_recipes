                    I found myself making this salad a lot during the pandemic. I love beets and eggs in salad, and I think a lot people can agree that roasted or grilled chicken on a salad is delightful.

                    I buy the Sweet Kale salad from Costco for this. You can probably make your own kale salad from scratch, but part of the reason for this is I'm not really a great cook, and I still wanted to eat relatively healthily. I also buy the prepared beets from Costco because roasting my own was always a pain.
