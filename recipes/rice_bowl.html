                    I started making this during the pandemic, and it evolved with the help of my wonderful fiancee, Cathleen. We use Mary's organic chicken, but any chicken will do. The veggies you use are really up to you and we encourage you to experiment, but the below mix is my personal favorite so far.

                    We use Bachan marinade these days, but I originally used Kinder's teriyaki for the chicken. Both work. You can really use any teriyaki sauce or chicken marinage you want!

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>
                We recommend preparing everything ahead of time before you start cooking since it really makes things easier for the novice chef and it makes it easier to time the cooking so everything comes off at the same time and is assempled and eaten while hot!

            <h3>Prep</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Marinade chicken for a couple of hours
                    <ul>
                        <li>Poke holes in the chicken with a form to help it absorb marinade</li>
                        <li>Using a large ziploc or reusable storage bag help as you can easily flip it and mold it to keep the chicken fully covered</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Chop veggies</li>        
            </ol>

                <li>Grill or pan roast chicken</li>
