                    This is the parfait I general make for breakfast every morning. It seems to be fairly health, feels affordable, and is quick to make. It generally makes me feel good after eating it and keeps me full for a few hours until lunch.

                    I usually buy all of this stuff from my local Costco, making it even more affordable. Costco is the best co!
