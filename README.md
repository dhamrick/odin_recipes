# odin_recipes

The purpose of this project is to use the basic HTML I have studied so far to 
build a basic recipe website. I think this largely focuses on basic HTML usage, 
like the boilerplate, paragraph and header tags, lists, and probably some link 
and images. Also using the emphasis and strong tags where appropriate.
