# odin_recipes

The purpose of this project was to use the basic HTML I have studied so far to 
build a basic recipe website.

I took the opportunity to do the boiler-plate from scratch and I am proud to say I can recreate it without too much help!

I wasn't sure about the target and rel tags for the a element and researched that. Pretty sure they aren't needed unless you are linking to an external site.

I reviewed the other entries on TOP site and it seems like most people went more into detail with the actual cooking istructions. I did not. Follow my recipes at your own peril!
